## Introduction
Dengue is a mosquito borne disease caused by dengue viruses. Over the years it has spread rapidly causing deaths due to different factors that are congenial for it. Dengue is primarily caused by mosquitoes. Hence, the factors like climate changes, temperature, population growth, unplanned and uncontrolled urbanizations, poor infrastructure which provide a favorable environment for the outspread of mosquitoes causing dengue should be monitored in order to reduce the effect of dengue. Through the identification of how the outbreak of dengue varies with these factors, this can be done.

This is based on DengAI, predicting disease spread competition hosted by Driven Data. with the task of predicting the number of Dengue cases in each week in each location. To obtain an accurate prediction, machine learning and data mining techniques can be used while considering both the direct and indirect factors affecting the outspread of dengue.

## Methodology

Following methods have been attempted for predicting the disease spread.
1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Analysis
3. XGBoost Prediction
4. Monthly Trend Prediction
5. Monthly Trend plus Residual Prediction
